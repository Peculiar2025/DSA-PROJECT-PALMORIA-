# DSA-PROJECT-PALMORIA GROUP HR ANALYSIS
This is an HR group analytic project using power bi to unleashed gender disparities in performance rating, compensation and departmental distribution in palmoria group.

# THE BACKGROUND
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues
bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently
published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This
doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the
business to other regions and even overseas.
The CEO of Palmoria, Mr Ayodeji Chukwuma, is keen to address these issues before they
get out of hand. The CHRO, Mr Yunus Shofoluwe, has been assigned the task to identify
key areas within the business that could give rise to issues and address them immediately.
Mr Shofoluwe decided to recruit me as an HR Analytics expert to analyse the company’s HR data.

# OBJECTIVE
